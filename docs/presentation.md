## Overview

- What is DevOps?
- Which parts of the software lifecycle does it cover?
  - Development
  - Distribution (I will focus on this today)
  - Operation
- What is "cloud native"?
- Why are "traditional" distribution methods still relevant?

## Development

- DevOps: Also includes development!
- Modern development should not be bound to any client attributes
- It should not matter if the client is a RISC-V Linux machine, a locked-down Windows workstation or an Android phone
- Development should be possible from any platform, for any platform
- The only truly cross-platform application framework is the web
- PWAs make it possible for web apps to have all the features native apps have
- PWAs work offline by default
- Why not make our development environments PWAs?
- Virtual machines and user-friendly hypervisors and containers make it possible to run the editor's backend locally too
- Source code can for example never leave the company's system
- Development environments can be quickly updated and tightened to prevent supply chain attacks and increase reproducibility
- Imagine: You find a Free Software project, and all you have to do in order to contribute is press "."!
- Onboarding new developers becomes much easier
- Independence of client choice enables the use of much cheaper or constrained client devices
- Open standards and web technologies enable the adoption of new client and server hardware (i.e. RISC-V chips) easier and enables the easy use of and testing on multiple architectures
- Autoscaling, ballooning etc. can be used server-side: There is no need to provision lots of development servers if no one is using them, and if there is a need for a lot of resources (for example if someone is compiling say a C++ project) the provisioner (i.e. Kubernetes) can dynamically decide to scale up the container or VM
- There is no need to trust a project's build system, everything can be sandboxed!

- There are already multiple "cloud IDEs"
- Most are based on VSCode (or, to be more precise, VSCode's API specification)
- VSCode (or its libre forks, like VSCodium) is already based on web technologies (Electron), so adapting it to run in the browser is possible
- Theia is an example of an alternative implementation of VSCode's API, which serves as a vendor-neutral implementation of VSCode
- Cloud-Native IDEs can either be self-hosted or public SaaS, so lets take a look at some of them!

- GitPod: Live demo
- Codespaces: Live demo
- pojde: Live demo

- But what if we want to develop things that one can't normally develop remotely?
- Apps which require Android devices as a target, require a programmer, USB or Bluetooth and are not using Web Bluetooth/Web Serial (i.e. Android apps, smart home projects, IoT devices, Arduinos)
  - Forward USB over IP
  - Formward DBus over IP for BlueZ
  - Use SSH tunnels
- Apps which require a Wayland compositor/a screen (i.e. desktop Linux apps, GTK/QT apps)
  - Waypipe
  - Use SSH tunnels
- Apps which require public ports
  - Reverse HTTPS/TLS/UDP/TCP proxies to the public web
  - Use SSH tunnels

## Distribution

### Basic Distribution Principles

- Binaries
- GPG signing and Gridge
- Cosign
- Portability
- Reproducibility
- Why we need more than "just binaries"

### Pipelines

- Bagop
- Hydrun
- GitHub Actions
- Semantic Release

### Distribution to RedHat Linux

- RPM packages

### Distribution to Debian GNU/Linux

- DEB package
- APT repository
- Yum repository

### Distribution to Linux (universal)

- Flatpak
- Flatpak repository

### Distribution to Android

- APK
- F-Droid repository

### Distribution to Windows

- MSI package with auto-updates

### Distribution to macOS

- DMG package with auto-updates

### Distribution to Kubernetes/the Cloud

- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Helm
- Skaffold

### Distribution to WebAssembly

- WASM-Binary
- WASI/wasm_exec equivalents

## Operation

- Sentry
- OpenTelemetry
- Prometheus
- Grafana
